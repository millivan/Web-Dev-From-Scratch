# Web-Dev-From-Scratch
My web dev learning from start to end, been jumping into web dev at intervals and have always been blur about certain concepts and code. Through this repo I hope that I can finally grasp everything from start to end.

Link to the tutorial that I am learning from: https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc

Link to the sample code from the tutorial: https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/html-css-course-2022/tree/main/1-exercise-solutions

Do note that all code/ exercises from this repo are from this YouTube tutorial with some minor modifications tailored to my personal preference.
